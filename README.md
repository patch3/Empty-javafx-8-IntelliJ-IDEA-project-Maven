# Empty javafx 8 IntelliJ IDEA project
In recent versions, IntelliJ IDEA has banned the creation of a javafx project in java 8. This creates problems, because java 8 is still the most common among java versions. Therefore, there is this repository that will allow you to download an already created javafx project.

The project was created on the version of IntelliJ IDEA 2021.1.3.
This is the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA that I found that allowed me to create a project in this version of java.

I also launched a project on IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1.1 and made some minor adjustments. The project is quietly launched and compiled!
